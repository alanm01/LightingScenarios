# How to Set Up Lighting Scenarios Using the Variant Manager

This document will take you step-by-step through the tasks required to set up a lighting scenario using the variant manager in Unreal Engine 4.

Using the variant manager is an alternative way to create lighting scenarios from the standard method.

The benefits of using the variant manager are:
* to speed up the iteration process.
* give better usability to team members.
* create a more organized file structure.


## Prerequisite

To use the Variant Manager, you need to have the **Editor > Variant Manager** plugin enabled for your project.

You need to be familiar with the basics of Lighting Scenarios and the Variant Manager.
